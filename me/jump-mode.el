;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; This mode abuses Emacs' tags feature to allow jumping between function
;; definitions.  A per-file tags file is generated for each file opened with
;; this mode, and it is updated whenever a function is added or removed from
;; the file.  Tags files are saved in your temporary directory and removed when
;; you quit Emacs.
;;
;; Symbols are prefixed with `jmp-'
